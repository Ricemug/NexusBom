  - Topological sorting (bottom-up and top-down)
  - Level grouping (parallel processing support)
  - Cycle detection

### 2. BOM Calculation Engine (`bom-calc`)

  - Bilingual comments

- ✅ **Detailed Documentation**
  - README.md
  - CHANGELOG.md
  - Code comments

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Parallel Computation
- Data parallelism using rayon
- Level parallelism: nodes at the same level can be processed in parallel
- Work-stealing load balancing

### Memory Optimization
- Arena allocator for contiguous memory allocation
- Reduced pointer chasing
- Improved cache locality

### Incremental Calculation
- Dirty flag mechanism
- Only recalculate changed subtrees
- Cache intermediate results

## 🚧 Future Features

### High Priority

1. **Caching Layer** (`bom-cache`)
   - L1: In-memory cache (moka)
   - L2: Persistent cache (redb)
   - Cache invalidation strategy

2. **FFI Bindings** (`bom-ffi`)
   - C ABI interface
   - Auto-generate headers (cbindgen)
   - Support Java/Python/.NET calls

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Large-scale BOM tests (1000+ components)
   - Parallel computation performance tests
   - Comparison with other BOM engines

### Medium Priority

4. **PLM/ERP Adapters** (`bom-adapters`)
   - SAP BAPI/OData interface
   - Oracle REST API interface
   - Generic REST API adapter

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Engineering BOM vs Manufacturing BOM
   - Routing integration
   - Batch processing optimization

### Low Priority

6. **SIMD Optimization**
   - Numerical computation acceleration
   - Batch cost calculation

## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### 1. Custom Graph Structure
Compared to general graph libraries (like petgraph), our implementation:
- Optimized for BOM characteristics (mostly tree-like, few shared parts)
- Better cache locality
- Incremental calculation support

### 2. Level-based Parallelism
Innovative parallel strategy:
- Topological sorting + level grouping
- Nodes in the same level have no dependencies, fully parallelizable
- Fully utilize multi-core CPU

### 3. SAP/Oracle Compatibility
Full support for enterprise PLM/ERP requirements:
- Effective dates
- Substitutes
- Phantom items
- Multi-organization
- Version control

## 📈 Future Outlook

### Short-term (1-2 months)
- Complete caching layer implementation
- Complete FFI bindings
- Establish benchmark suite

### Mid-term (3-6 months)
- SAP/Oracle adapter implementation
- Real customer pilot
- Performance tuning

### Long-term (6-12 months)
- SIMD optimization
- Distributed computing support
- Cloud-native deployment

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Build a Custom Graph Structure?
- General graph libraries have too many features and unnecessary overhead
- BOM has specific patterns (mostly tree-like, few shared parts)
- Need incremental calculation support

### Why Use Arena Allocator?
- Reduce memory fragmentation
- Improve cache hit rate
- Simplify lifetime management

### Why Choose rayon?
- Easy-to-use parallel API
- Work-stealing automatic load balancing
- Well-integrated with Rust ecosystem
